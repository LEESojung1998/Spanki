Splicing Analysis Kit (Spanki) v.0.2.0
--       --       --


Overview
==============
Spanki is a set of tools to facilitate analysis of alternative splicing from
RNA-SEQ data.  Drawing from multiple published and novel analysis methods,
Spanki compiles quantitative and qualitative information about junction
alignments and splicing events.  The basic functions of Spanki are to assess
confidence in junction alignments, and to quantify and compare splicing events.
