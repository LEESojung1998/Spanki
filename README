Splicing analysis toolkit (Spanky) v.0.1.2

Overview
==============
Spanky is a set of tools to facilitate analysis of alternative splicing from
RNA-SEQ data.  Drawing from multiple published and novel analysis methods,
Spanky compiles quantitative and qualitative information about junction
alignments and splicing events.  The basic functions of Spanky are to assess
confidence in junction alignments, and to quantify and compare splicing events.


Getting started
===============

Prerequisites
---------------

Spanky requires the following python packages (Python will attempt to install them for you):
	pyfasta
	pysam
	numpy
	Biopython
	scikits.statsmodels
	fisher

Other programs:
Required for all functions:
	samtools	http://samtools.sourceforge.net/
	Cufflinks	(Spanky uses the gtf_to_sam utility to create a sam representation of a gtf reference)  http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu
Required for splicing analysis:
AStalavista (or a precomputed splicing event file) http://genome.crg.es/astalavista/

Installation
---------------
Decompress the program files spanky.0.1.2.tar.gz
Then use the python install process:
	sudo python setup.py install
